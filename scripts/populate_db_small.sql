    (1, "Recently I learned that bok choy is the number one vegetable in China. It seems to be the number one vegetable in my <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/csa/\">CSA</a> box lately. It's a very healthy vegetable with a ton of vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin K plus and is even a good source of calcium and iron, but I have to admit, after serving it steamed or saut√©ed again and again, I was looking for a new way to prepare it.<br />
        <br />
        As luck would have it, at a Chinese New Year\'s dinner I stumbled upon a terrific dish at <a href=\"http://www.fangrestaurant.com/\">Fang restaurant</a>. It was served raw, as a salad with a soy and sesame vinaigrette alongside some chunks of short rib. Bok choy is very mild flavored but it has great texture. The leaves are tender and somewhat herbal without being bitter, and the stems are very juicy and crisp. I had never considered using bok choy in salad but after trying that dish, I couldn\'t stop thinking about it.<br />
        <br />
        Looking around online I found plenty of Asian inspired recipes for bok choy salad, and a few takes on coleslaw and even a chopped salad. My idea was to make a more Italian style salad using extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and Parmigiano Reggiano. The result is a salad at once familiar and yet fresh. It\'s a great choice for a potluck or dinner party, because it is very sturdy and won't easily wilt. You could mix in other greens, add cherry tomatoes or even fresh fava beans when in season.<br />
        <br />
        <b>Bok Choy Salad</b><br />
        1 serving (multiply for as many servings as you like)<br />
        <br />
        Ingredients<br />
        <br />
        1 cup sliced bok choy<br />
        1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br />
        1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil<br />
        Salt<br />
        Parmigiano reggiano, preferably young less than 18 months<br />
        Croutons<br />
        Freshly ground pepper<br />
        <br />
        Instructions<br />
        <br />
        Toss the bok choy in a bowl with the lemon juice and olive oil and a tiny pinch of salt. Shave long strips of Parmigiano using a vegetable peeler and add those and about five or so croutons to the bok choy. Season with pepper before serving.<br />
        <br />
        Enjoy!<br />
